-Take some ideas from https://insideevs.com/
-Put all content in one div container and use grid display
    -This works but the issue I have is that the image doesn't fit into
    the dimensions of the column
    -Continue: One thing I could consider is putting a pixelation restriction on
    the width and height of each div rather than using fr that way the
    web page doesn't look odd
     -Populate the landing page so you have a good layout moving on.
     -Make page content shift left
-For now I think I need to create another row that populate the landing page
-Since the page will focus on EVs. Then I think I should remove the
macrosector idea. Overtime, I'll want to make it a simple webpage that laypeople
can understand.
-Continue:
    -Start adding new HTMLs?
        -I'm not sure how to do display the page and how the page should be displayed. So far
        -i'm thinking production estimates,quarter results,new products, demand related things, PR news. Since i'll be working
        on this web page myself, I don't think I should populate it too much, I think I should
        put certain things for each company and change them as time goes
        -I need to add a button that goes back to the home page
    -Finish CSS vid, watch HTML,  then react
    -PHP
    -Create a drop down nav bar for the landing page, so if you hover over an icon
    it will display a drop down menu
    -This video might help with navBar idea
    -React
    -finish Udemy vids
    -publish website by the end of next month
-Web page changes: I decided to go with American, Chinese, European, Other. Going
with Sedan, Trucks, Buses, Charging Companies would cause a lot of redundancies due
to companies being in more than one category.
-I have to give more thought to what I want the site to be about. I want to it to be more
substantive. I think i could have it be a one stop location for articles related to evs. The
crud aspect of the application could be people subscribing to?
-Work on getting the nav bar centered
-The approach i'm going to take for this is following the class. At least
that way I'll have a good foundation on what i'm learning and can improve on that
if i take an alternative approach it will be undirected and take up too much time
because I won't know what i'm doing/or understand what i'm reading.I think I'll always
have to take a general course that encompasses all the concepts superficially,
then I'll have to take courses to get better at a particular concept.

-Figure out what to populate the nav bar with. You may have to expand the scope/topics of the site
    -American, Chinese, European, Companies that have both combustion and electric
-They could be a list of links that you toggle over
-Color all website headers black
-Put lines/grids on page. I don't think a div can fit a whole page unless
it's filled with content. So for now, just populate an organize both divs
-You may have to align the MacroEncon news Header better. I doesn't have to be the same as the
Personal consumption index header
-Fill the landing page with more content
-Attach other html pages to the main page
-Add a HTML
-How do I center and size the text under the Personal Consumption Expenditures?
-Difference between link,img, and anchor.
Notes:

-What's the difference between anchor and href
-Look into how to modify the nav bar

Q:I'm not sure what I want to make this site about
